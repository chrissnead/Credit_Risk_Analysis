# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview
This analysis uses machine learning to predict credit risk. Using different techniques and models, we can assess the potential risk based on the outcomes of the models.

## Results
Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all six machine learning models. Use screenshots of your outputs to support your results.


## Summary
Based on the six models used, the EasyEnsembleClassifier is by far most accurate with an accuracy percentage of 93.2% and precision of 9%, therefore would be recommended for use in assessing credit risk. The least recommended would have to be the ClusterCentroid as the results are far from accurate with a percentage of 54.4% accuracy and 1% precision.
